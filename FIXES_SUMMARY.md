# ShareKoro - 500 Internal Server Error Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. PHP Version Compatibility
- Changed .htaccess to use PHP 8.0 instead of PHP 8.1 for better InfinityFree compatibility

### 2. Missing Database Columns
- Created update_database.php script to add missing columns:
  - visibility (ENUM: public, private, protected)
  - access_password (VARCHAR(255))
  - access_code (VARCHAR(10))

### 3. Syntax Errors in Share Files
- Fixed missing opening braces in POST handling sections of:
  - share-text.php
  - share-code.php
  - share-file.php

### 4. Improved Error Logging
- Added proper error reporting to config.php
- Created error_debug.php for custom error pages
- Created error.log file with proper permissions

### 5. File Permissions
- Set proper permissions for uploads directory
- Created error.log file with write permissions

## New Files Added

1. debug.php - Database connection and configuration testing
2. error_debug.php - Custom 500 error page with debugging info
3. update_database.php - Database schema update script
4. test.php - Simple PHP info testing
5. install_check.php - Installation verification script
6. error.log - Error logging file

## Verification Steps

1. Run update_database.php to ensure database schema is current
2. Test share-text.php, share-code.php, and share-file.php
3. Check debug.php for any remaining issues
4. Verify error.log is being populated with any errors

## Additional Notes

- The main cause of the 500 errors was likely missing database columns that the share files were trying to use
- Syntax errors in the share files would also cause immediate 500 errors
- Proper error logging will help identify any future issues more quickly
