# ShareKoro Content Visibility Features

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of content visibility features in ShareKoro, which allow users to control who can access their shared content through three distinct visibility levels:

1. **Public** - Visible to everyone
2. **Private** - Password protected
3. **Protected** - 4-character access code required

## Feature Implementation

### 1. Database Schema Updates
The database schema was updated to support visibility levels:
- Added `visibility` column (ENUM: 'public', 'private', 'protected')
- Added `access_password` column for private content
- Added `access_code` column for protected content

### 2. User Interface Enhancements
All share creation forms were updated with:
- Visibility selector dropdown
- Dynamic password/access code fields
- Visual badges indicating visibility level
- Proper validation for required fields

### 3. Processing Logic Updates
The share processing logic was enhanced to:
- Handle visibility selection
- Store appropriate access credentials
- Set correct public visibility flags

### 4. View Page Implementation
The view page was updated to:
- Check visibility level before displaying content
- Show appropriate access forms for private/protected content
- Implement proper validation for passwords/access codes
- Display visibility badges on share pages

### 5. Admin Panel Updates
The admin panel was enhanced to:
- Show visibility badges in share listings
- Maintain consistent styling with frontend

## Security Features

### Password Protection
- Private shares require a password set by the creator
- Passwords are hashed using secure hashing algorithms
- Password validation occurs before content display

### Access Code Protection
- Protected shares require a 4-character access code
- Codes are randomly generated and displayed to creators
- Access codes are validated before content display

### Database Security
- Proper parameterized queries prevent SQL injection
- Input validation prevents malicious data entry
- Secure session management protects user data

## User Experience Benefits

### For Content Creators
1. **Granular Control**: Choose appropriate visibility for different content types
2. **Security Options**: Multiple ways to restrict access
3. **Ease of Use**: Simple interface for setting visibility levels
4. **Flexibility**: Mix and match public and restricted content

### For Content Consumers
1. **Clear Expectations**: Know upfront what access is required
2. **Simple Access**: Straightforward password/code entry
3. **Trust Indicators**: Visual cues for content security level
4. **User-Friendly**: Intuitive navigation and access workflows

## Technical Implementation Details

### Frontend Components
- Dynamic form fields based on visibility selection
- Client-side validation for required fields
- Real-time access code generation
- Password visibility toggles

### Backend Logic
- Database schema updates with proper indexing
- Secure password hashing
- Efficient visibility-based querying
- Proper error handling and validation

### Security Measures
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- Password strength enforcement
- Session security

## Testing and Validation

All visibility features have been thoroughly tested:
- Public shares display content immediately
- Private shares require correct password
- Protected shares require correct access code
- Database schema updates applied correctly
- Admin panel displays visibility badges
- Proper error handling for invalid access attempts

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements include:
1. **Time-Based Access**: Scheduled visibility changes
2. **IP Restrictions**: Geographic or IP-based access control
3. **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Additional security layers
4. **Access Analytics**: Detailed access tracking and reporting
5. **Group Permissions**: Shared access for specific user groups

This implementation significantly enhances ShareKoro's flexibility and security while maintaining the platform's user-friendly approach to content sharing.
