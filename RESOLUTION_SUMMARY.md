# ShareKoro 500 Error Resolution Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Circular Dependency in Functions.php
**Problem**: The `functions.php` file had a redundant `require_once 'db.php'` statement that was causing a circular dependency with the `init.php` file.

**Solution**: 
- Removed the redundant `require_once 'db.php'` from `functions.php`
- Ensured proper loading order in `init.php`

**Files Modified**:
- `functions.php` - Removed redundant require statement
- `init.php` - Improved loading order and error reporting

### 2. .htaccess Configuration Issues
**Problem**: The original .htaccess file may not have been properly configured for InfinityFree hosting.

**Solution**:
- Created an optimized .htaccess file with proper PHP version specification
- Added error document handling
- Included URL rewriting rules

**Files Added**:
- `.htaccess` - Main configuration file
- `.htaccess.minimal` - Minimal version for testing

### 3. Session Handling Issues
**Problem**: Potential session configuration issues that could cause 500 errors.

**Solution**:
- Improved session initialization in `init.php`
- Moved error reporting to the beginning of the init file
- Ensured proper session lifetime configuration

### 4. Error Reporting and Debugging
**Problem**: Lack of proper error reporting made it difficult to identify issues.

**Solution**:
- Enabled comprehensive error reporting in `init.php`
- Created multiple debugging scripts to identify specific issues
- Added detailed logging capabilities

## Debugging Tools Created

1. **install.php** - Automated installation and system check
2. **debug.php** - Basic system and database debugging
3. **error_debug.php** - Detailed error debugging with step-by-step testing
4. **troubleshoot.php** - Comprehensive troubleshooting with detailed reporting
5. **redirect_test.php** - URL rewriting and redirect testing
6. **index-simple.php** - Simplified index file for basic functionality testing
7. **index-step-by-step.php** - Progressive index loading to identify failure points
8. **index-minimal.php** - Minimal index file for basic functionality verification
9. **test-init.php** - init.php loading and functionality test
10. **session-test.php** - Session handling test
11. **final-test.php** - Complete verification test
12. **test.php** - Simple PHP functionality test
13. **phpinfo.php** - PHP configuration information

## Key Changes Made

### functions.php
- Removed redundant `require_once 'db.php'` that was causing circular dependency

### init.php
- Reordered file loading to ensure proper sequence
- Moved error reporting to the beginning of the file
- Improved session initialization
- Ensured configuration is loaded before session settings

### .htaccess
- Added proper PHP version specification for InfinityFree
- Included URL rewriting rules
- Added security headers
- Configured error document handling

## Deployment Recommendations

1. **Upload all files** to your InfinityFree hosting account
2. **Test with debugging scripts** to verify each component
3. **Check error logs** if issues persist
4. **Verify .htaccess configuration** matches your PHP version
5. **Ensure file permissions** are set correctly (755 for directories, 644 for files)
6. **Delete debugging files** after successful deployment for security

## Common InfinityFree Issues

### PHP Version
- InfinityFree supports PHP 7.4, 8.0, and 8.1
- If one version doesn't work, try another in .htaccess:
  ```
  # Try PHP 7.4
  AddHandler application/x-httpd-php74 .php
  
  # Or PHP 8.0
  AddHandler application/x-httpd-php80 .php
  
  # Or PHP 8.1
  AddHandler application/x-httpd-php81 .php
  ```

### File Permissions
- Directories: chmod 755
- Files: chmod 644
- Uploads directory must be writable

### Database Connection
- Verify database credentials in config.php
- Ensure database is created and accessible
- Check that database tables are imported

## Testing Sequence

1. Run `install.php` to verify system requirements
2. Run `debug.php` to check database connectivity
3. Run `test-init.php` to verify init.php loading
4. Run `final-test.php` for complete verification
5. Try accessing `index-minimal.php` directly
6. If all tests pass, try accessing the main `index.php`

## If Issues Persist

1. Check `php_errors.log` for specific error messages
2. Try different PHP versions in .htaccess
3. Test with minimal .htaccess file
4. Verify all core files are uploaded correctly
5. Check InfinityFree control panel for any account issues
6. Contact InfinityFree support if hosting-related issues persist

The fixes implemented should resolve the 500 Internal Server Error and get your ShareKoro installation working properly on InfinityFree hosting.
