- Created proper indexes for performance

### 3. User Interface Enhancements
- Visibility selector dropdown in all share creation forms
- Dynamic password/access code fields that appear only when needed
- Visual badges indicating content visibility level
- Proper validation for required fields
- Auto-generation of 4-character access codes

### 4. Processing Logic
- Updated share creation logic to handle visibility selection
- Proper storage of access credentials
- Correct setting of public visibility flags based on visibility level

### 5. View Page Implementation
- Visibility-based content display logic
- Password form for private shares
- Access code form for protected shares
- Proper validation before content display
- Visibility badges on share pages

### 6. Admin Panel Updates
- Visibility badges in share listings
- Consistent styling with frontend
